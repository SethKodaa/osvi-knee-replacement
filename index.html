    <h1>Knee Replacement</h1>
    <p>
      Knee replacement is a procedure carried out to relieve pain and restore function in severely diseased knee joints. 
      Patients typically undergo this treatment when other non-surgical options have failed. 
      The procedure involves replacing damaged joint surfaces with prosthetic components, enabling improved mobility and reduced discomfort.
    </p>
    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
    <p>
      Patients undergoing knee replacement will typically spend several days in hospital, followed by a period of rehabilitation.
      Physical therapy is critical to ensure proper joint movement and a successful recovery.
